# Prototype single page point of entry to the topic of open source

The original purpose of this project was to define, collect, or otherwise produce support materials to support Senior IT decision-makers in adopting open source ideas. It was being done as part of a client project, but after conversations with a number of people, it didn't seem like it was going to meet the immediate client needs. I think there is a need for something that functions as a "front door to open source in government". I'll continue to talk with people about this, but at this point an not continuing work on it.

**Feel free to reuse. I won't be supporting it at this time.**

This is project was built using the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards).
